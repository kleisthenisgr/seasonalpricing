Seasonal pricing for Motors (vehicle rental) Wordpress theme

Using Advanced Custom Fields Pro repeater field, you can now have 2 seasons on the Motors theme. 
This Wordpress plugin reads vehicle ID or product id and if the booking date starts outside of July or August, it applies a discount, according to the value found registered with ACF. 
It ignores non variable products in the cart, hides the prices in the selection page so as to avoid deviation and adjusts the single product shown price accordingly.
